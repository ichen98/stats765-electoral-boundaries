STATS 765 data analysis project
Ian Chen


This is my 2020 SEM1 STATS 765 data analysis project, completed at the University of Auckland.

This project looks at the changes in electoral boundaries, analyses the effects they have on changes in party votes between electorates and attempts to make a prediction on the 2020 New Zealand general election party vote.

Datasets used for this analysis are not included here as they are too large to fit on GitHub. These include electoral party vote data from 2017, electoral boundaries to be used for the 2017 and 2020 general elections, meshblock data for the 2017 and 2020 general elections and electorate lists for 2017 and 2020.
